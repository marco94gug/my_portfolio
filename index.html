                Hello! My name is Marco and I enjoy creating things that live on
                the internet. My interest in web development started from
                childhood, when I decided to try editing custom Tumblr themes.

                  The environment of this work experience was fantastic and

                  In this work experience I had the opportunity to be the leader

                  work.
